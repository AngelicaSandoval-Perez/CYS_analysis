# Analysis Cysteines

Analysis of the changing enviroment of cysteines according to their oxidation state.

The analysis of neighbors contain the  following files:

- [Extraction of neighbors around the cysteine residue](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Cysteins_enviroments_counting.ipynb)

-[Counting number of residues extracted with the Jupyther Notebook 1](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Extract_numbersFromEnviromentsOutFiles.ipynb)

Examples of input files and output files are found in the [folder of examples] (https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/tree/main/examples_inputfiles)
