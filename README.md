# Analysis Cysteines

Analysis of the changing enviroment of cysteines according to their oxidation state.

The analysis of neighbors contains the  following jupyther notebooks:

- [JPN1: Extraction of neighbors around the cysteine residue](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Cysteins_enviroments_counting.ipynb)

- [JPN2: Counting number of residues extracted with JPN1](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Extract_numbersFromEnviromentsOutFiles.ipynb)

- [JPN3: Plotting the results as networks](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/blob/main/Jupyther_notebooks/Plotting_SGneighbors_asNetworks.ipynb)

Examples of input files and output files are found in the [folder of examples](https://github.com/AngelicaSandoval-Perez/CYS_analysis/tree/main/examples_inputfiles)
